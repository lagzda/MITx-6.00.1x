Problem Sets for MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python
Hi! I've recently started MITx's 6.00.1x course online in edx.org

Set'x' folders are for the actual problems provided by the university to solve
Algorithms folder is for algorithms that I found useful to figure out, learn and note down
Exercises folder is just random stuff I wanted to see how it works.
